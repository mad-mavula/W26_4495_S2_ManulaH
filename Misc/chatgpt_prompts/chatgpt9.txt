Overview of Design Science Research Stages

Design Science Research is a problem-solving research methodology that structures inquiry around the design, development, and evaluation of artifacts intended to address identified organizational or technical problems. In applied IT and cybersecurity research, DSR is commonly structured into the following stages.

1. Problem Identification and Motivation
Purpose

The objective of this stage is to clearly define a relevant, real-world problem and justify why it warrants research attention.

Academic framing

This stage involves:

Identifying a practical challenge encountered in operational environments

Describing the context in which the problem occurs

Explaining the limitations of existing approaches or tools

Example (generic wording)

In complex IT environments, operational and security incidents often manifest through similar system-level signals, creating ambiguity during incident response and leading to delayed or misaligned escalation.

This stage establishes relevance, not solutions.

2. Definition of Objectives for a Solution
Purpose

To translate the identified problem into explicit design objectives that guide artifact creation.

Academic framing

Rather than hypotheses, DSR defines:

Functional objectives (what the solution should enable)

Quality objectives (clarity, usability, decision support)

Contextual constraints (operational realism, integration feasibility)

Example phrasing

The objective of this research is to design a framework that supports security-aware incident classification by operationalizing reliability metrics in a decision-support context.

These objectives later serve as evaluation criteria.

3. Design and Development of the Artifact
Purpose

This stage focuses on the creation of the research artifact, which embodies the proposed solution.

Academic framing

Artifacts in DSR may take the form of:

Frameworks

Models

Methods

Decision-support tools

Prototypes

The design process is informed by:

Prior research

Domain knowledge

Practical constraints

Key academic emphasis

Design rationale: why the artifact is structured as it is

Traceability: linking artifact components to problem objectives

Example phrasing

Based on the defined objectives, a reliability-driven decision framework is designed to structure how SRE metrics are interpreted and applied during incident response.

4. Demonstration
Purpose

To show that the artifact can be used to address the problem in a realistic context.

Academic framing

Demonstration typically involves:

Scenario-based application

Walkthroughs

Simulated or hypothetical use cases

Metric or log replays

This stage answers:

Can the artifact be applied in practice?

Example phrasing

The proposed framework is demonstrated using representative incident scenarios to illustrate how reliability signals can be interpreted to support incident classification and prioritization.

5. Evaluation
Purpose

To assess how well the artifact meets its objectives.

Academic framing

Evaluation in DSR is:

Contextual rather than universal

Utility-focused rather than theory-driven

Common evaluation approaches include:

Comparative analysis against existing practices

Scenario-based assessment

Expert feedback

Qualitative or semi-quantitative scoring

Example phrasing

The framework is evaluated based on its ability to improve incident classification clarity and response prioritization when compared to traditional reliability-focused incident handling approaches.

Importantly, evaluation focuses on usefulness and decision improvement, not predictive accuracy.

6. Discussion and Reflection
Purpose

To critically reflect on:

Findings

Trade-offs

Limitations

Applicability

Academic framing

This stage situates the artifact within:

Practical constraints

Organizational realities

Future improvement opportunities

Example phrasing

The discussion highlights the strengths and limitations of the proposed framework, including its dependency on metric quality and the role of human judgment in final incident classification.

7. Contribution to Knowledge
Purpose

To articulate the research contribution, which in DSR is primarily design knowledge.

Academic framing

Contributions may include:

Novel artifact designs

New ways of operationalizing existing metrics

Practical guidance for practitioners

Bridging previously separate domains (e.g., SRE and security)

Example phrasing

This research contributes a structured framework that bridges Site Reliability Engineering and cybersecurity incident response by demonstrating how reliability metrics can be systematically leveraged for security-aware decision-making.

One-Paragraph Summary (Proposal-Ready)

You can safely use or adapt this:

Design Science Research structures this study around the identification of a practical operational problem, the definition of solution objectives, and the design, demonstration, and evaluation of an artifact intended to address that problem. The artifact, in the form of a decision-support framework, is designed to improve incident classification and prioritization by operationalizing Site Reliability Engineering metrics in a security-aware context. The research emphasizes practical utility and contextual evaluation, aligning with the applied nature of IT and cybersecurity research.
