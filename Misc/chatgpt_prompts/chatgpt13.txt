Core Principle (Anchor This First)

Applied research evaluates usefulness, plausibility, and decision support — not real-world deployment performance.

You are not claiming:

production readiness

real-time accuracy

zero false positives

You are claiming:

improved reasoning

clearer decisions

better prioritization

practical applicability

That framing is key.

Common Evaluation Strategies Without Production Data
4
1. Scenario-Based Evaluation (Most Common)

What it is
You construct realistic but hypothetical incident scenarios based on:

documented outages

known attack patterns

common operational failures

public postmortems

How it works

Define multiple scenarios (e.g., DoS vs misconfiguration)

Apply your framework step by step

Show classification, prioritization, and escalation outcomes

Why it’s valid

Widely used in DSR

Mirrors tabletop exercises used by real teams

Evaluates decision logic, not detection accuracy

Example phrasing

The framework was evaluated using representative incident scenarios to assess its ability to support incident classification and prioritization in the absence of production data.

2. Comparative “Before vs After” Reasoning

What it is
You compare:

baseline practice (reliability-only interpretation)
vs

your framework’s interpretation

Evaluation focus

clarity of classification

confidence of escalation

consistency of decisions

What you measure (qualitatively)

ambiguity reduced (yes/no)

severity alignment improved (low/medium/high)

escalation appropriateness

This is very acceptable in applied research.

3. Synthetic / Simulated Metric Data

What it is
You generate controlled metric traces that resemble production behavior:

traffic spikes

latency inflation

error bursts

burn rate acceleration

Why it works

You control cause → effect

You can isolate patterns

You avoid confidentiality issues

You’re not validating realism — you’re validating interpretation logic.

4. Expert or Practitioner Evaluation (Even Small-Scale)

What it is

Feedback from:

SREs

DevOps engineers

security students / practitioners

Even 2–5 reviewers is fine in applied coursework

What you ask

Does this make sense operationally?

Would this help during incident response?

Is the reasoning understandable?

Why it’s strong

Anchors your framework in practice

Compensates for lack of production data

Often scores highly with professors

5. Walkthrough-Based Demonstration

What it is

Step-by-step walkthrough of:

metrics observed

correlation applied

decision reached

This shows:

internal consistency

transparency

explainability

Reviewers care more about reasoning clarity than raw data.

What You Explicitly Acknowledge (This Builds Credibility)

Strong applied projects state limitations openly:

No live production data

No claim of real-time accuracy

No automated detection

No organizational deployment

Then you say:

The evaluation focuses on decision support and interpretive clarity rather than empirical performance metrics.

That sentence protects you academically.

Proposal-Ready Evaluation Paragraph (Safe to Use)

You can use something like this directly:

Due to the absence of access to production system data, the proposed framework is evaluated using scenario-based analysis and comparative reasoning. Representative operational and security incident scenarios are constructed based on common reliability failures and documented attack patterns. The framework is applied to each scenario to assess its ability to support incident classification and response prioritization. Evaluation focuses on decision clarity, interpretability, and alignment with operational expectations rather than detection accuracy or performance metrics.

This is completely defensible.

What Reviewers Look For (Not What They Say They Look For)

They want to see:

Logical consistency

Realistic assumptions

Clear reasoning

Honest scope

Practical relevance

They do not expect:

real logs

production access

SOC approval

enterprise validation

Especially in applied academic settings.

One-Line Defense (Very Useful)

If challenged directly, say:

In applied Design Science Research, frameworks are evaluated based on their ability to support reasoning and decision-making under realistic constraints, rather than through deployment on live production systems.

That’s a standard position.

Quiet Truth (Worth Knowing)

Many published applied security papers:

never touched production data

relied on scenarios, simulations, or expert review

still made valid contributions

Your project fits that lineage.
