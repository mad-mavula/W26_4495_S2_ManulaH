1. What “Clear and Measurable” Means in Applied SRE Research

In applied / DSR work, measurable does not mean:

statistically generalizable

mathematically provable

universally optimal

It does mean:

observable in practice

evaluable via scenarios, metrics, or expert judgment

tied to concrete artifacts or decisions

Your questions meet those criteria.

2. Let’s Stress-Test Each Research Question
RQ1 — Design Clarity

How can a reliability-driven decision framework be designed to distinguish security-driven incidents from operational incidents in modern distributed systems?

Clarity: ✅

Clear “how can” → design

Clear artifact → decision framework

Clear distinction → security vs operational

Measurability: ✅

You can show the framework

You can apply it to incident scenarios

You can demonstrate classification outcomes

How it’s evaluated in practice:

Does the framework exist?

Can it be applied consistently?

Does it produce a classification decision?

💡 This is measured by existence, applicability, and internal consistency — which is exactly right for DSR.

RQ2 — Metric Operationalization

Which Site Reliability Engineering metrics can be operationalized to support the classification and prioritization of security-related incidents during operational disruptions?

Clarity: ✅

“Which metrics” is concrete

“Operationalized” implies rules or mappings

“Classification and prioritization” defines the output

Measurability: ✅

You can list metrics

You can define thresholds, patterns, or heuristics

You can demonstrate how they affect decisions

How it’s evaluated in practice:

Are metrics explicitly defined?

Are decision rules documented?

Do different incidents map to different severities?

RQ3 — Evaluation & Utility

To what extent does the proposed framework improve incident classification clarity and response prioritization compared to traditional reliability-only incident handling approaches?

Clarity: ✅

Clear comparison baseline

Clear outcome (clarity & prioritization)

Measurability: ✅ (for applied research)

Before vs after comparison

Scenario-based evaluation

Expert feedback

Reduced ambiguity or faster escalation

Typical evaluation methods:

Incident scenarios (DoS vs misconfig)

Qualitative scoring (low/medium/high clarity)

Practitioner feedback

Decision latency comparison

💡 “To what extent” gives you flexibility — that’s good, not weak.

3. Why These Are Perfect for an SRE-Focused Security Study

They:

Start from reliability signals, not threat intel

Fit on-call / incident response workflows

Avoid promising detection accuracy

Focus on decision quality, not prediction

That aligns with:

SRE principles

Operational reality

Applied research expectations

4. Minor Refinements (Optional but Nice)

If you want them slightly tighter academically, here are safe tweaks:

Polished Version (Optional)

RQ1

How can a reliability-driven decision framework be designed to support the classification of security-driven versus operational incidents in distributed systems?

RQ2

Which SRE metrics and reliability indicators can be operationalized to inform the classification and prioritization of security-related incidents?

RQ3

To what extent does the proposed framework improve incident classification clarity and response prioritization when compared with reliability-only incident handling practices?

These don’t change meaning — they just sound extra clean.

5. Quick Professor-Defense Answer (Memorize This)

If asked “Are these measurable?” you can say:

Yes. Each research question is evaluated through the design and application of a concrete artifact, supported by scenario-based analysis and comparative evaluation against existing operational practices. The focus is on practical decision improvement rather than theoretical optimality.

That answer lands well.

6. Verdict

✔ Clear
✔ Scoped
✔ Evaluatable
✔ Applied
✔ SRE-aligned
✔ Security-relevant

You’re not over-claiming, and you’re not under-specifying — that’s exactly where good applied research lives.
