First Principle: What You’re Evaluating (and What You’re Not)

You are not evaluating:

detection accuracy

false positive rates

real-time performance

production reliability

You are evaluating:

decision support quality

interpretability

classification consistency

prioritization usefulness

That framing makes these criteria reasonable.

Core Evaluation Criteria (Proposal-Safe)
1. Classification Clarity

Question it answers:

Does the framework reduce ambiguity when interpreting incidents?

How to evaluate:

Was the incident classified as operational vs security-driven?

Was the classification supported by explicit reasoning?

Would different evaluators reach similar conclusions?

Scoring example:

Low: unclear or conflicting signals

Medium: partial clarity

High: clear classification with justification

2. Consistency Across Scenarios

Question it answers:

Does the framework behave predictably across different cases?

How to evaluate:

Apply the same logic to multiple scenarios

Observe whether similar patterns produce similar outcomes

Why it matters:
Consistency builds trust in operational settings.

3. Metric Interpretability

Question it answers:

Are metric correlations understandable to practitioners?

How to evaluate:

Can the decision logic be followed step-by-step?

Are correlations explainable without advanced math?

Applied relevance:
Black-box reasoning is a liability in incident response.

4. Incident Prioritization Usefulness

Question it answers:

Does the framework help rank incidents by urgency and impact?

How to evaluate:

Does it assign severity or confidence levels?

Does prioritization align with expected operational response?

Example outcomes:

Immediate escalation

Monitor closely

Defer investigation

5. Decision Confidence

Question it answers:

Does the framework increase confidence in response decisions?

How to evaluate:

Are decisions backed by multiple correlated signals?

Is escalation justified rather than reactive?

This is especially important in security contexts.

6. Alignment with Operational Expectations

Question it answers:

Do the outcomes make sense to experienced practitioners?

How to evaluate:

Compare framework output with how incidents are typically handled

Use expert or peer judgment (even informally)

This grounds your work in reality.

Optional (Nice-to-Have) Criteria

These are useful but not mandatory:

7. Scope Sensitivity

Does the framework distinguish localized vs system-wide impact?

8. Escalation Appropriateness

Does it recommend involving security teams only when warranted?

9. Explainability

Can the framework justify why an incident was flagged as security-relevant?

Example Evaluation Table (You Can Use This)
Criterion	Description	Evidence Source
Classification clarity	Reduced ambiguity in incident type	Scenario walkthrough
Metric interpretability	Decision logic understandable	Framework explanation
Prioritization usefulness	Clear severity ranking	Scenario outcomes
Consistency	Similar patterns → similar decisions	Cross-scenario analysis
Operational alignment	Matches expected response	Expert/peer feedback

This kind of table looks very professional in a proposal.

Proposal-Ready Evaluation Paragraph

You can safely use something like this:

The proposed framework is evaluated using simulated incident scenarios based on common operational failures and security-related events. Evaluation focuses on classification clarity, consistency across scenarios, metric interpretability, and the usefulness of incident prioritization. Rather than measuring detection accuracy, the evaluation assesses the framework’s ability to support clear, explainable, and operationally reasonable decision-making under realistic constraints.

One-Line Rule of Thumb

If a criterion measures how well people can make decisions using the framework, it is appropriate for applied evaluation.

Quiet but Important Insight

Reviewers rarely penalize what you evaluate — they penalize:

unclear criteria

mismatched claims

overpromising

You’re doing the opposite: your criteria match your claims perfectly.
