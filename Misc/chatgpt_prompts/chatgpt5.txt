1. How DSR Research Questions Differ (Conceptually)
❌ What DSR questions are not

Avoid questions like:

“Why does X happen?”

“What is the true cause of Y?”

“Is X better than Y in all cases?”

Those are explanatory / theoretical.

✅ What DSR questions are

DSR questions focus on:

How can we design…

What artifacts can support…

To what extent does an artifact help…

How effectively does a solution address…

They are:

Problem-solving

Artifact-oriented

Context-bound

Evaluation-aware

In DSR, the question is not “Is this true?”
It’s “Does this work well enough to solve the problem?”

2. The Core DSR Question Pattern (Very Useful)

Most strong applied DSR projects follow this structure:

Design question – what are we building?

Implementation question – how is it realized?

Evaluation question – how well does it perform?

Utility question – how useful is it in practice?

You don’t need all four, but 2–3 is ideal.

3. Generic DSR Question Templates (Steal These)

You can safely reuse these patterns:

How can a [framework / model / tool] be designed to address [practical problem] in [context]?

What design principles or metrics are most effective for supporting [decision/task]?

To what extent does the proposed artifact improve [outcome] compared to existing practice?

How effectively can [inputs] be operationalized to support [goal]?

4. Tailored Research Questions for Your Project (Proposal-Ready)

Here’s a clean, applied set you can directly use or lightly tweak.

RQ1 — Design Focus

How can a reliability-driven decision framework be designed to distinguish security-driven incidents from operational incidents in modern distributed systems?

Why this works:

“How can” → design-oriented

“framework” → artifact

“distinguish” → decision problem

Context-specific, not universal

RQ2 — Metric Operationalization

Which Site Reliability Engineering metrics can be operationalized to support the classification and prioritization of security-related incidents during operational disruptions?

Why this works:

Focuses on using existing metrics

Avoids inventing theory

Emphasizes practical operationalization

RQ3 — Evaluation / Utility

To what extent does the proposed framework improve incident classification clarity and response prioritization compared to traditional reliability-only incident handling approaches?

Why this works:

“To what extent” → evaluation, not proof

Compares against real practice

Allows qualitative + scenario-based evaluation

(Optional) RQ4 — Tool Support

If you’re building a dashboard or web interface:

How can a visualization-based decision-support tool enhance practitioners’ ability to interpret reliability signals for security-aware incident response?

This is very applied and very defendable.

5. What to Avoid in Your Question Wording

🚫 Avoid these phrases:

“prove that”

“determine the true cause”

“predict attacks”

“achieve perfect detection”

“universally classify incidents”

Those push you into theoretical or unrealistic territory.

6. Mapping Questions → DSR Outputs (Prof-Friendly)

You can even show alignment like this:

Research Question	DSR Output
RQ1	Conceptual framework
RQ2	Metric mapping + decision rules
RQ3	Evaluation via scenarios
RQ4	Prototype dashboard

That screams applied.

7. One-Line Rule of Thumb (Memorize This)

If your research question can be answered by building and evaluating something, it’s a Design Science question.

Yours absolutely can.
