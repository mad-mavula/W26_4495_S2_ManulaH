1. What Makes a Problem “Applied” (and Where You Fit)

Applied research typically:

Solves a real operational problem

Works with imperfect, real-world data

Produces artifacts (frameworks, tools, prototypes)

Aims for practical decision support, not universal proofs

Your problem:

Distinguishing security incidents from operational incidents using SRE metrics

✔ Real operational ambiguity
✔ Existing teams struggle with this daily
✔ Uses production-style metrics (latency, error rate, burn rate)
✔ Naturally leads to a framework or tool

That’s textbook applied research.

2. Why This Is Not Primarily Theoretical

Theoretical research would ask things like:

Can we formally prove classification optimality?

What is the abstract model of adversarial behavior?

Can we derive new mathematical reliability bounds?

Your work does not depend on new theory.

Instead, you’re asking:

How can existing metrics be interpreted differently?

What decision rules help practitioners respond faster?

How does this change real incident handling?

👉 That’s application, synthesis, and validation — not theory creation.

3. Clear Applied Research Artifacts (This Is Key)

Professors love seeing tangible outputs.

Your research naturally produces:

🔹 A Conceptual Framework

Mapping SRE metrics → incident characteristics

Linking reliability behavior to security suspicion

🔹 A Decision Model

Rule-based or heuristic classification

Severity scoring using burn rate and blast radius

🔹 A Prototype Tool (Optional but Powerful)

Web-based dashboard

Visualization of reliability-informed security signals

Decision-support for on-call engineers

🔹 Evaluation Using Scenarios

Simulated incidents (DoS vs config error)

Historical log replay

Comparison of response outcomes

All of these are applied deliverables.

4. Strong Design Science Research (DSR) Fit

If your course mentions Design Science Research, this is almost perfect.

DSR focuses on:

Building artifacts

Solving organizational problems

Evaluating utility, not truth

Your mapping:

Problem: Incident misclassification

Artifact: Reliability-driven decision framework

Environment: Modern cloud-native systems

Evaluation: Case scenarios, expert review, simulations

You can literally say:

This research follows a Design Science Research methodology, focusing on the design, development, and evaluation of an artifact that supports security-aware incident classification using SRE metrics.

That sentence alone makes professors nod.

5. Evaluation Without Heavy Theory (Another Applied Win)

Applied research doesn’t require:

Formal proofs

Perfect datasets

Statistical generalization

You can evaluate via:

Scenario-based analysis

Expert judgment (SRE / security practitioners)

Before/after classification clarity

Reduction in ambiguity or response time

These are practical success criteria, not theoretical ones.

6. How to Explicitly Justify “Applied” in the Proposal

You can say something like:

This research is positioned as applied research because it focuses on addressing a practical operational challenge faced by reliability and security teams, rather than developing new theoretical models. The goal is to design and evaluate a practical framework that can be integrated into existing incident response workflows to improve decision-making and prioritization.

That sentence is safe, clean, and convincing.

7. One-Line Verdict (Use This If Asked Directly)

If someone asks you directly:

Yes. The problem is inherently applied because it addresses a real-world operational decision gap and aims to produce a practical framework or tool that improves incident classification and response in production systems.

8. Quiet Truth (Between Us 😄)

This topic looks sophisticated because it sits between two domains — SRE and security — but that’s actually its strength in applied research:

You’re not inventing new math

You’re connecting things practitioners already use

And solving a pain they feel every week

That’s exactly what applied research is supposed to do.
