Perfect — now we’re at the core of your research 👌
What you need is a minimal, high-signal metric set that can answer two questions:


Is this likely a security incident?


What is the impact / severity (from an SRE perspective)?


I’ll give you a clean, research-ready metric taxonomy, not a bloated SIEM checklist.

1️⃣ Core SRE Reliability Metrics (Your Primary Signals)
These are mandatory. They form the backbone of security impact and severity.
🔹 Latency
What to track


p95 / p99 response latency


Endpoint-specific latency (e.g. /login, /api/*)


Why it matters for security


Layer-7 DoS


Credential stuffing


Bot abuse


Security signal


Latency ↑ without proportional legitimate traffic growth


Latency ↑ concentrated on auth or sensitive endpoints



🔹 Error Rate
What to track


4xx rate (especially 401, 403)


5xx rate


Error rate per endpoint


Why it matters


Brute-force → spike in 401s


API abuse → unusual 4xx patterns


DoS → backend 5xx


Security signal


Sustained auth errors + retries


Error rate ↑ + saturation ↑ = attack likelihood high



🔹 Traffic Volume
What to track


Requests per second (RPS)


Traffic per endpoint


Traffic per client / IP (coarse)


Why it matters


Traffic shape matters more than raw volume


Security signal


Traffic ↑ but user diversity ↓


Traffic spike isolated to one endpoint


High request rate from few sources



🔹 Saturation
What to track


CPU usage


Memory usage


Thread / connection pool utilization


Why it matters


Attacks consume shared resources


Security signal


Saturation ↑ without deployment or feature change


Resource pressure correlated with specific request patterns



2️⃣ Error Budget & SLO Metrics (Your Novelty Layer)
This is where your work becomes SRE-centric and not just monitoring.
🔹 Error Budget Burn Rate
What to track


Error budget consumption over time


Burn rate (how fast budget is being used)


Why it matters


Converts technical degradation → user impact


Enables severity classification


Security signal


Fast burn rate = high-impact incident


Low burn rate = suspicious but non-critical


📌 This metric answers: “How urgent is this?”

🔹 SLO Violation Windows
What to track


Time to first SLO breach


Duration of breach


Why it matters


Security incidents that affect users should violate SLOs


Helps distinguish noise from real incidents



3️⃣ Security-Indicative Behavioral Metrics (Lightweight, Not SIEM)
These are supporting metrics, not deep security telemetry.
🔹 Authentication Failure Rate
What to track


Failed logins per minute


Success-to-failure ratio


Security signal


Brute force / credential stuffing


Password spraying



🔹 Unique Client / IP Cardinality (Approximate)
What to track


Number of unique IPs per time window


IP churn rate


Security signal


Many IPs + same endpoint = botnet


Few IPs + high rate = scripted attack



🔹 Request Distribution Entropy
What to track


How evenly traffic is spread across endpoints


Security signal


Legit traffic → diverse


Attacks → concentrated


(You don’t need fancy math — simple ratios are enough.)

4️⃣ Correlation Metrics (Where “Detection” Actually Happens)
These are derived relationships, not raw metrics.
🔹 Metric Correlation Patterns
Track co-occurrence, not values:
PatternLikely MeaningLatency ↑ + Saturation ↑ + Traffic ↑L7 DoSAuth failures ↑ + 401s ↑ + IP diversity ↑Brute forceTraffic ↑ + single endpoint focusAPI abuseErrors ↑ but no saturationLogic / config issue
📌 This is where you infer “security” instead of “outage”.

5️⃣ Incident Impact Metrics (For Evaluation & Reporting)
These help you quantify impact, which professors love.
🔹 User Impact


% of failed requests


% of users affected


Duration of degraded experience


🔹 Recovery Metrics


Time to detection (TTD)


Time to mitigation (simulated)


Error budget recovered post-incident



6️⃣ Minimal Metric Set (If You Want to Be Extremely Lean)
If someone asks:

“What’s the smallest set you actually need?”

Answer:

Latency, error rate, traffic, saturation, authentication failures, and error budget burn rate.

That’s it. Everything else is derivative.

7️⃣ How This Looks in Your Framework (One-Line)

“Security incidents are inferred by correlating reliability degradation patterns with lightweight behavioral signals, and their severity is determined using SLO error budget consumption.”

That sentence alone explains your metrics philosophy.

8️⃣ Next (Very Useful Step)
If you want, I can:


Map each attack type → exact metric pattern


Define threshold-free decision rules


Create a 1-page metric → decision table


Help you justify why you intentionally excluded many security metrics
